# Mouse Tweaks
A mod that enhances the inventory management by adding various additional functions to the usual mouse buttons.

# How to build
`gradlew build`

# Compatibility
Mouse Tweaks should work with everything based on `ContainerScreen`. If your GUI isn't based on `ContainerScreen`, or if you want to provide additional compatibility, take a look at `src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/`.
